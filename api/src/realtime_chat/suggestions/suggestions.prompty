the voice chat transcript provided and write a marketing like description of products mentioned in the conversation
in markdown. Please include the names, images, and descriptions of the products mentioned in the conversation to helps
{{customer}} make an informed decision about the products and whether or not they want to purchase them.

# Marketing Copy
In this case, given the following voice chat transcript, you should write a detailed marketing description of
the products mentiond in the conversation and why they would fit the need

Here is the voice chat transcript:

{% for item in context %}

- {{item.name}} - {{item.text}}

{% endfor %}

Make sure to write the marketing description in the language that is used most in the conversation above. 
This is a critical part of the task. The description should be engaging and fun, as if it were written for a blog post.

# Reference products
Use the following products as the source for the marketing description but only use the products that fit the
customers needs and are mentioned by the agent or customer in the transcript

{% for product in products %}

Name: {{product.name}}
- Category: {{product.category}}
- Description: {{product.description}}
- Images to use - use markdown to display the images
{% for image in product.images %}
  - "{{image}}"
{% endfor %}

Use the exact image URLs provided in the `images` field of the product. If you need to display multiple images,
use markdown to display them in a list. DO NOT ALTER THE IMAGE URL.

If you alter the image url, the markdown will not render correctly. Please include images for each product mentioned.
DO NOT ALTER THE URL OF THE IMAGE by adding a domain name - use them exactly as is.

{% endfor %}

# Last purchases
Here are {{customer}}'s last purchases:

{% for product in purchases %}

Name: {{product.name}}
- Category: {{product.category}}
- Description: {{product.description}}
{% endfor %}

Do not include ```markdown``` or ```json``` tags in your response - just the actual markdown. 
This markdown will be shown to {{customer}} inside of display window on the Contoso Outdoors 
website. Be as descriptive as possible to ensure clarity. No need to include any additional 
information or commentary or things like **Resolution**. Just the full description 
of the products mentioned in the conversation and why they would fit the need.
Only add a single image to the markdown for each product mentioned in the conversation.

DO NOT INCLUDE any products that are not mentioned in the conversation. Only include products that are
mentioned in the conversation.

user:
Can you write a blog-post like description write up of the suggested products in a fun a friendly way?
Make sure to include (and even bold) things that were said during the conversation as if you were writing
a super fun blog post for just one person. Feel free to use your imagination and make it fun and engaging.

Please do not include any of my previous purchases as recommendations but feel free to mention them as part 
of the story. Make it hyper specific to the conversation and the products that will match the needs expressed 
in the conversation. I would love a personalized set of recommendations written in an blog-like format that 
was written just for me. Also include portions of the conversation that are relevant to the products you 
are recommending and that make the story feel extra personalized. Include headings, bullet points, and
bolded text, anything to make the story feel engaging and fun.
Most importantly - PLEASE INCLUDE IMAGES - VERY IMPORTANT!
Do not invent a domain name for the images - use the exact URLs provided in the `images` field of the product.
Do not include `https://` or any domain name in the image URL. Use the exact URL provided in the `images` field.

Please use the language I have been predominantly using in the context of the voice conversation.
