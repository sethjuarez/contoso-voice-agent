 - user - Is there a way to see the products you are recommending?
 - assistant - Sure! I can provide a write up of the products mentioned in the conversation.

The correct response would be "YES" because the user is asking for a write up or visual description of the 
products mentioned in the conversation AND the assistant echoes that back to the user.

# Example 3
Given the following voice chat transcript:

 - assistant - I understand you're gearing up for a snow camping trip and want to stay warm and safe out there. With the image you shared earlier of a tent in snowy conditions, it looks like you're well-prepared with your SkyView 2-Person Tent. Before we dive into product recommendations, is there anything else I should know about your trip?
 - user - Is there a way to see the products you are recommending?

The correct response would be "NO" because even though the user is asking for a write up 
or visual description of the products mentioned in the conversation, the assistant does not 
echo that back to the user.
