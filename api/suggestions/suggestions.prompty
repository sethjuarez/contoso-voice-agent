the products mentiond in the conversation and why they would fit the need

Here is the voice chat transcript:

{% for item in context %}

- {{item.name}} - {{item.text}}

customers needs and are mentioned by the agent or customer in the transcript

{% for product in products %}

Name: {{product.name}}
- Category: {{product.category}}

Use the exact image URLs provided in the `images` field of the product. If you need to display multiple images,
use markdown to display them in a list. DO NOT ALTER THE IMAGE URL.

user:
Can you write a blog-post like description write up of the suggested products in a fun a friendly way?
Make sure to include (and even bold) things that were said during the conversation as if you were writing
a super fun blog post for just one person. Feel free to use your imagination and make it fun and engaging.

Please do not include any of my previous purchases as recommendations but feel free to mention them as part 
of the story. Make it hyper specific to the conversation and the products that will match the needs expressed 
in the conversation. I would love a personalized set of recommendations written in an blog-like format that 
was written just for me. Also include portions of the conversation that are relevant to the products you 
are recommending and that make the story feel extra personalized. Include headings, bullet points, and
bolded text, anything to make the story feel engaging and fun.
Most importantly - PLEASE INCLUDE IMAGES - VERY IMPORTANT!
Do not invent a domain name for the images - use the exact URLs provided in the `images` field of the product.
Do not include `https://` or any domain name in the image URL. Use the exact URL provided in the `images` field.

Please use the language I have been predominantly using in the context of the voice conversation.
