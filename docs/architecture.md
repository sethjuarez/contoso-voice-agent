# System Architecture

## Overview

The Voice + Text Configurator is a real-time communication system that enables natural interaction between users and an AI assistant through both voice and text. The system consists of several key components working together to provide a seamless experience.

## Key Components

### Web Client
- **Audio Processing**
  - Recording: Captures audio input from user's microphone
  - Playback: Handles audio output from AI responses
  - WebSocket client for real-time streaming
  - Audio device management
  
### API Server
- **FastAPI Backend**
  - WebSocket endpoints for chat and voice
  - Session management
  - Message routing
  - Integration with Azure services
  
### Azure Voice Services
- Speech-to-text (STT)
- Text-to-speech (TTS)
- Voice activity detection (VAD)
- Real-time streaming support

## Communication Flow

### Voice Communication
1. **Client Initialization**
   ```
   [Browser] -> Initialize Audio -> [MediaDevices API]
             -> Connect WebSocket -> [Server]
   ```

2. **Audio Streaming**
   ```
   [Microphone] -> Record -> [WebSocket] -> [Server]
                -> Process -> [Azure Voice] -> STT
                -> AI Processing
                -> TTS -> [Server] -> [WebSocket] -> [Audio Player]
   ```

3. **Voice Activity Detection**
   ```
   [Audio Stream] -> [VAD] -> Detect Speech
                          -> Calculate Threshold
                          -> Manage Silence
   ```

### Text Communication
1. **Chat Flow**
   ```
   [Client] -> Send Message -> [WebSocket] -> [Server]
            -> Process Context -> [AI Assistant]
            -> Generate Response -> [Server]
            -> [WebSocket] -> [Client Display]
   ```

2. **Session Management**
   ```
   [Client] -> Connect -> [Server]
            -> Create/Resume Session
            -> Maintain State
            -> Handle Disconnects
   ```

## Error Handling

### Client-Side
1. **Network Issues**
   - WebSocket reconnection logic
   - Audio buffer management
   - State recovery

2. **Audio Device**
   - Permission handling
   - Device selection
   - Format compatibility

### Server-Side
1. **Session Errors**
   - Connection timeouts
   - State consistency
   - Resource cleanup

2. **Service Integration**
   - Azure service resilience
   - Error response handling
   - Fallback strategies

## Performance Considerations

1. **Real-time Processing**
   - Audio buffer sizes
   - WebSocket message frequency
   - Voice activity thresholds

2. **Resource Management**
   - Session cleanup
   - Memory usage
   - Connection pooling

## Security

1. **Communication**
   - WebSocket security
   - Audio data handling
   - Session isolation

2. **Authentication**
   - API access control
   - Session validation
   - Service credentials

## Monitoring

- Real-time metrics
- Error tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Session analytics
